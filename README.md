# Nougat+ Tasker Tethering Control

This is a Magisk Module to do a systemless install of matejdro's [Nougat+ Tasker Tethering Control](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.matejdro.taskertethercontrol&hl=en)

He did all the work, I just packaged it into a Magisk module. - [mike-s123 @ github](https://github.com/mike-s123/)

This contains version 1.4 of the app. May need root on some phones. It works for me, on a Pixel (2016) running Oreo 8.1. In my experience, it may take some time after a reboot (on the order of 5 minutes) before it begins working. There seems to be a blocking process which needs to start first.

YMMV. No promises, use at your own risk. Objects are closer than they appear.
